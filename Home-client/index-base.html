                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign exchange market, which is usually known as ‚Äúforex‚Äù or ‚ÄúFX,‚Äù is the largest financial market in the world.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FX market is a global, decentralized market where the world‚Äôs currencies change hands. Exchange rates change by the second so the market is constantly in flux.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a tiny percentage of currency transactions happen in the ‚Äúreal economy‚Äù involving international trade and tourism like the airport example above.
                Instead, most of the currency transactions that occur in the global foreign exchange market are bought (and sold) for speculative reasons.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currency traders (also known as currency speculators) buy currencies hoping that they will be able to sell them at a higher price in the future.
                Compared to the ‚Äúmeasly‚Äù $22.4 billion per day volume of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the foreign exchange market looks absolutely ginormous with its $6.6 TRILLION a day trade volume.
                That‚Äôs trillion with a ‚Äút‚Äù. Let‚Äôs take a moment to put this into perspective using monsters‚Ä¶
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest stock market in the world, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), trades a volume of about $22.4 billion each day. If we used a monster to represent the NYSE, it would look like this‚Ä¶
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks intimidating. Looks like it works out. Some may even find it sexy.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hear about the NYSE in the news every day‚Ä¶ on CNBC‚Ä¶ on Bloomberg‚Ä¶on BBC‚Ä¶ heck, you even probably hear about it at your local gym. ‚ÄúThe NYSE is up today, blah, blah‚Äù.
                When people talk about the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, they usually mean the stock market. So the NYSE sounds big, it‚Äôs loud and likes to make a lot of noise.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you actually compare it to the forex market, it would look like this‚Ä¶
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oooh, the NYSE looks so puny compared to the forex market! It doesn‚Äôt stand a chance!
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes you wonder if the ‚ÄúS‚Äù in NYSE stands for ‚ÄúStock‚Äù or for ‚ÄúScrawny‚Äù? ü§£
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the graph of the average daily trading volume for the forex market, New York Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and London Stock Exchange:
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The currency market is over 200 times BIGGER! It is HUGE! But hold your horses, there‚Äôs a catch!
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That huge $6.6 trillion number covers the entire global foreign exchange market, BUT the ‚Äúspot‚Äù market, which is the part of the currency market that‚Äôs relevant to most forex traders is smaller at $2 trillion per day.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, if you just want to count the daily trading volume from retail traders (that‚Äôs us), it‚Äôs even smaller.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to determine the exact size of the retail segment of the FX market, but it‚Äôs estimated to be around 3-5% of overall daily FX trading volumes, or around $200-300 billion (probably less).
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, the forex market is definitely huge, but not as huge as the others would like you to believe.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don‚Äôt believe the ‚Äúforex is a $6.6 trillion market‚Äù hype! The huge number sounds impressive, but a bit misleading. We don‚Äôt like to exaggerate. We just keepin‚Äô it real.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from its size, the market also rarely closes! It‚Äôs open virtually round the clock.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forex market is open 24 hours a day and 5 days a week, only closing down during the weekend. (What a bunch of slackers!)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unlike the stock or bond markets, the forex market does NOT close at the end of each business day.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, trading just shifts to different financial centers around the world.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day starts when traders wake up in Auckland/Wellington, then moves to Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Frankfurt, London, and finally, New York, before trading starts all over again in New Zealand!

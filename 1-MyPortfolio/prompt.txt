create an html file that will ask for the user to upload either an excel or csv file. the contents of the csv file is in Kanji, hiragana, English word format. Then the html file will create 2 csv files. the format of the newly created csv files will be 
1. 1st CSV file - (Kanji, Hiragana I English) : notice that the Hiragana and English word is combined but separated only by " |"
2. 2nd CSV file - (English, Kanji | Hiragana) : notice that the Kanji and Hiragana word is combined but separated only by " |"

These 2 csv files must be able to download by the user.
